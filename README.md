Abstract
----
The idea behind this project was to implement and study biofeedback features in the popular video game Tetris, using EDA (Electrodermal activity). The goal was to explore if it is possible to deliberately alter live EDA measurements using a Q-Sensor wristband along with the game. Our implementation can change the speed of the game according to the current EDA value of the player. The problem was studied by issuing a user test experiment along with a survey questioning how test subjects responded to the biofeedback features. Results seemed to show that manipulating EDA in our version of Tetris seems possible, although subjects could only alter EDA for shorter periods of time rather than manipulating a general value.
More accurate results would require more work and knowledge than presented in this study.
